Weather Prediction Project | Kaggle Competition

Built an end-to-end machine learning regression project to predict next-day minimum temperature using two weeks of historical weather data.

What I worked on:

* Data cleaning & preprocessing (dates, missing values, messy columns)
* Feature engineering (date features, lag features, rolling averages)
* Model training with **Random Forest Regressor**
* Model evaluation using **MAPE**
* Generated a **submission-ready CSV** for Kaggle

Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
 Kaggle Competition: *Weather Prediction 2025*

This project strengthened my skills in **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression modeling**.
